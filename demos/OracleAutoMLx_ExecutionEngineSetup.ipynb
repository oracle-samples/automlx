    "On average, Ray will be faster than Multiprocessing, which is in turn faster than threading.\n",
    "Note that the multi-threading engine is confined by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) of the Python language, and hence cannot use more than two threads (i.e. one CPU) for its compute. This backend however might be suitable for prediction service deployments in production containers\n",
    "as it does not require file writes to disk (such as those needed by Ray and multiprocessing to escape the GIL).\n",
    "Using the multiprocessing and threading engines might be suitable for single-node executions with low levels of parallelization (that is, a few concurrent tasks).\n",
    "Moreover, Ray is the only engine that supports distributed training.\n",
    "Thus, Ray is generally the recommended engine for AutoMLx."
