    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build and evaluate a machine learning model using Oracle AutoMLx. The first dataset is a binary classification dataset.\n",
    "We explore the various options provided by Oracle AutoMLx, allowing the user to specify different options in the training procedure. We then evaluate the model trained by AutoMLx.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data analytics and modeling problems using Machine Learning (ML) are becoming popular and often rely on data science expertise to build accurate ML models. Such modeling tasks primarily involve the following steps:\n",
    "- Preprocessing the dataset (for example, cleaning, imputing, engineering features and normalization).\n",
    "- Picking an appropriate model for the given dataset and prediction task at hand.\n",
    "- Tuning the chosen model’s hyperparameters for the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these steps are significantly time consuming and heavily rely on data scientist expertise. Unfortunately, to make this problem harder, the best feature subset, model, and hyperparameter choice widely varies with the dataset and the prediction task. Hence, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to achieve reasonably good model performance. Using a simple Python API, AutoML can quickly jump-start the datascience process with an accurately-tuned model and appropriate features for a given prediction task.\n",
